ChangeLog


2.0

- Increased performance for large tables significantly (from 4 seconds on each Ajax call for a 10,000 row table to 0,2 seconds).
- The grid is now able to fall back to GET parameters if JavaScript is disabled (VIEW mode only).
- Added support for joins of multiple tables.
- Changed the hover behaviour when over table headers for sorting.
- Replaced Xajax with HTML_Ajax - you can now use Javascript in the table.
- Rewrote the Excel export to be faster and more compatible.
- Replaced the functions that mark columns as "email", "url" or "image" with a more flexible plugin-based system.
- Cleaned up HTML.
- Added "Cancel" link when editing rows.
Backwards incompatible changes:
- Placed all style information into external CSS styles, removed therefore all style functions.
- Removed functions to get and set the selected row - can be readded later based on user feedback.


2.0rc1
- Fixed "all" plugin.
- Added "field" as argument to plugins.
- Fixed display of accents/umlauts with HTML_AJAX.

2.05beta - Bug Fixes
- Hacked HTML_AJAX - there seems to be an incompatiblity with PHP 4.x.
- Fixed support for WHERE clause in SetSqlSelect().
